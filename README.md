## Background
- Describe the background of the problem you are trying to solve and why it is important. 

<a name="goals"/>

## Goal(s)
- List 2-3 goals

<a name="DataCollectionandDataCleaning"/>

## Data Collection and Data Cleaning
- Describe where the data came from
- Describe data shape
- Describe cleaning process
- Discuss if there is missing data and how you approached dealing with it
- Describe data science pipeline (include image if you have one)

<a name="FeatureSelection"/>

## Feature Selection/Feature Engineering 
- Discuss feature engineering process 
- Discuss feature selection process 

<a name="modeling"/>

## Modeling
- Discuss model selection process
- Discuss hyperparameter tuning 

<a name="Results"/>

## Results
#### Discuss Model Evaluation Including:
- Accuracy and other metrics
- Confusion matrix
- Cross-validation
- Bias and variance trade-off
- Overfitting and underfitting
- Feature importance
- Interpretability

<a name="FinalThoughts"/>

## Final Thoughts
- Discuss any obstacles in developing the model and how you overcame them
- Pros/Cons of each decision you made throughout the project and what you have learned overall from the project

<a name="NextSteps"/>

## Next Steps
#### Here are some options:
- Increase the amount of data
- Incorporate more features
- Experiment with different algorithms
- Validate the model on a different dataset
- Develop a user interface
